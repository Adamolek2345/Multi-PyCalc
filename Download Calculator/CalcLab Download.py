#All the code in here was written by me (Adamolek2345) for the Python Calculators repository on GitHub.
#Feel free to join my project and contribute, to make more of these !

#This is the one of the first calculators in my repository; It will be updated
#This is a download speed calculator made to calculate download speeds.
#I want to mention that this is Version 1.0 of this calculator; If you find any issues, report them to my GitHub.
#Thank you so much for downloading my project. It is a huge help, that will let me make more of these types of scripts.
